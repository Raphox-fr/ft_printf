🖨️ ft_printf - 42 Project
ft_printf is a reimplementation of the standard printf function in C. 
This project at 42 School focuses on handling formatted output, variable arguments, and buffer management while maintaining efficiency and correctness.

🏆 Objectives
Understand variadic functions using stdarg.h.
Implement formatted output handling for different data types.
Optimize buffer management for better performance.
Improve skills in string manipulation, recursion, and memory management.

📌 Project Details
Supports the following conversion specifiers:
%c → Character
%s → String
%p → Pointer address
%d / %i → Signed integer
%u → Unsigned integer
%x / %X → Hexadecimal (lowercase & uppercase)
%% → Percent sign
Must handle flags, width, and precision correctly.
No use of malloc (except for printf("%s", str)).
The function should behave as closely as possible to the standard printf.

⚙️ Technologies
C programming
Variadic functions (stdarg.h)
String manipulation & formatting
Bitwise operations & buffer management

This project is an excellent introduction to low-level function implementation and prepares students for more advanced I/O handling and system-level programming.
